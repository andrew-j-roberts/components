# components
ðŸ’… styled-components, â¬¢ styled-system, ðŸ”© reakit, and ðŸ““ storybook


For my [personal site](https://github.com/andrew-j-roberts/personal-site) I intended to build it from scratch to practice building a component library.
This was my attempt at that.  It's incomplete, but I learned how to set up a mono repo, how to run Storybook with custom plugins, npm publish lifecycle stuff, etc.

My site load times were too long, and I realized how much work it would be to fix these issues.  I'm opting to switch to Chakra UI and call it a day.
