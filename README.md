# components
ðŸ’… styled-components, â¬¢ styled-system, ðŸ”© reakit, and ðŸ““ storybook


For my [personal site](https://github.com/andrew-j-roberts/personal-site) I intended to build it from scratch to practice building a component library.
This was my attempt at that.  It's incomplete, but I learned how to: set up a mono repo, run Storybook with custom plugins, publish an npm package, and setup a component-driven development workflow.  So I consider this incomplete project a success.
 
After I gave Tailwindcss a shot, I decided it would be more valuable to use a commonly known styling system so others can use my code as a reference.
