# components
ðŸ’… styled-components, â¬¢ styled-system, ðŸ”© reakit, and ðŸ““ storybook


For my [personal site](https://github.com/andrew-j-roberts/personal-site) I intended to build it from scratch to practice building a component library.
This was my attempt at that.  It's incomplete, but I learned how to: set up a mono repo, run Storybook with custom plugins, publish an npm package, and setup a component-driven development workflow.  So I consider this incomplete project a success.

My site load times were too long because I just stuffed a bunch of stuff in one package â€”Â custom SVGs and all.  I've never had to worry about package size before and now I realize why it matters.  Instead of spending the time fixing these issues, I think I'll stop at this learning moment and switch to Chakra UI so I can focus on other problems.
